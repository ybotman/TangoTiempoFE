    1.	Luxon vs. Dayjs:
    •	Luxon is better suited for handling timezones in your context. It offers comprehensive timezone support out-of-the-box, which simplifies managing conversions between UTC and local times.
    •	Dayjs requires additional plugins for timezone support and may not be as feature-rich as Luxon for complex timezone management.
    2.	Managing Timezones Efficiently:
    •	Input & Storage: Convert all user-entered times to UTC before storing them in MongoDB. Luxon can easily handle this conversion.
    •	Display: When retrieving dates, convert UTC times to the user’s local timezone using Luxon before displaying them.
    •	Consistency: Ensure that all date manipulations use Luxon to maintain consistency across the application.
    3.	LocalizationProvider & TimezoneContext:
    •	LocalizationProvider: Wrap your application with MUI’s LocalizationProvider, configured to use Luxon. This ensures that all MUI date and time components utilize Luxon for localization.
    •	TimezoneContext: Implement a global TimezoneContext to manage and provide the user’s timezone throughout the app. This context can store the user’s timezone and offer functions to convert times as needed.

Best Practices:

    •	Store in UTC: Always store dates in UTC in your database to avoid discrepancies.
    •	Client-Side Conversion: Perform timezone conversions on the client side to ensure users see times in their local timezone.
    •	Consistent Library Usage: Use Luxon consistently for all date and time operations to reduce complexity and potential bugs.
