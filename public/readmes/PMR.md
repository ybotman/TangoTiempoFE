# PMR System - New Folder Structure and Process.
# Legacy system do not use

do not use this to build PMR's there is a newwer standard.  THis is leacy historical refreence info only.

---

## Purpose

Plan Migration and Retirement (PMRs) documents capture major platform changes: system migrations, retirements, data model shifts, and major architectural refactors.  
They provide a phased, verifiable, auditable roadmap for implementation.
Note that some old PMR do not follow this docuemnt and we are not retrofillting old ducments to new standards.

This README governs PMRs created after the folder structure update.  
(PMRs before this still live under the legacy system.)

---

## Folder Structure

Each PMR now lives in its own folder.

| Path                                               | Contents                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/public/pmr/PMR_Current/PMR_<topic>/`             | Active PMR and all related documentation      |
| `/public/pmr/PMR_Completed/PMR_<topic>/`           | Completed PMR and all supporting docs, archived |

Inside each PMR folder are documents. Build only the documents you deem necessary based on the scope:

- `PMR_<topic>.md` → Main document  
- Additional supporting files (optional):  
  - `PMR_<topic>_Communication.md`  
  - `PMR_<topic>_Summary.md`  
  - `PMR_<topic>_Approach.md`  
  - `PMR_<topic>_API_Changes.md`  
  - `PMR_<topic>_UI_Changes.md`  

---

## Required Structure for `PMR_<topic>.md`

Each PMR must follow this template:

---

# PMR_<topic>

### Status & Next Steps

This centralizes status across all phases.  
Keep this table updated continuously.

| Phase     | Status                                | Next Step             | Last Updated |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1:  | ✅ Complete / 🚧 In Progress / ⏳ Pending / ❌ Blocked | Short action description | YYYY-MM-DD   |
| Phase 2:  |                                     |                      |              |
| Phase 3:  |                                     |                      |              |

✅ No more updating status in multiple places. This is the one source of truth.

## PMR Process

1. Create Folder: `/public/pmr/PMR_Current/PMR_<topic>/`  
2. Write `PMR_<topic>.md` following the structure above.  
3. Optional: Add supporting files (Communication, API changes, etc.).  
4. Maintain Status & Next Steps table during active work.  
5. When completed:  
   - Move folder to `/public/pmr/PMR_Completed/`  
   - Update any cross-PMR references if needed.

---

## Best Practices

- **Markdown Only:** All PMRs written in `.md` format.  
- **Small, Verifiable Phases:** Each phase should be individually stable and testable.  
- **Clear Status Tracking:** Always update the Status & Next Steps table first.  
- **Linked Documents:** Keep supporting files in the PMR folder itself.  
- **Rollback Plans:** Always be ready to revert safely.  
- **History Friendly:** Every major update should leave a clean audit trail.
