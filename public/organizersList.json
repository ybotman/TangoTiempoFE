She is a life-long dancer and one of North America&#8217;s tango pioneers since 1990. Hsueh-tze has been traveling to Buenos Aires annually since 1998. She draws inspiration from her extensive experience dancing with milongueros, especially at many of the classic milongas of the early days of tango&#8217;s current revival (e.g., Pavadita, Almagro, Regin, Canning, Sin Rumbo, etc.). Her dance blends the richness of tango tradition with exploratory possibilities.</h4>\n<p>Hsueh-tze is highly regarded for her skills and astute insights. She is equally adept at both leading and following, with 28 years of experience dancing both roles. She has taught throughout the US, and also in Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico and Buenos Aires. In her classes, Hsueh-tze integrates her knowledge of dance, physiology and biomechanics to focus on quality of movement, musical communication and improvisation. Her dedicated students are sought as perceptive and musically expressive partners, having solid fundamental skills that enable them to develop their own style.</p>\n<p>Hsueh-tze hosts and DJs Blue Milonga, the popular second Saturday milonga in Boston.</p>\n<p>She holds a doctorate in physiology from Harvard University, and won a teaching award as a Harvard Teaching Fellow. Formerly a biology professor at Wellesley College, Hsueh-tze became one of the first professional North American tango instructors.</p>",

He then ran the business and invited the professional full time 2016 US Tango Champions Adam Cornett and Tilly Kimm to take over the studio.
