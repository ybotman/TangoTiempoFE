While there are many facets to the Argentine Tango—the music and the culture being among the most prominent—it is the dance that brings most of us together.\r\nThe Tango is a social and participant’s dance and is for everyone to learn and enjoy, regardless of dance background!\r\n\r\nOur membership has people from all walks of life, and has probably 20 or more countries represented! !\r\n<h2><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></h2>\r\nWe are not just a paper organization! Our numerous activities fall into two broad categories:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Planning Tango events</strong>\r\n\r\nWeekly Wednesday evening Tango dances at 16 Bow St, Union Sq, Somerville open to all, with a 1-hour lesson at the beginning\r\nWeekend Tango seminars several times a year with the best Tango teachers in the world (usually from Argentina), such as the one with the renowned Pablo Veron, Fernanda Ghi and Guillermo Merlo, Daniela Arcuri, Hector Falcon, to name a few.\r\nMilongas (Tango dance socials), some with live music\r\nSpecial and unusual Tango events such as outdoor “Tango by Moonlight” nights in summer\r\nOur Annual Boston Tango Festival in June\r\n\r\n<strong>2.

In 2017 Adam and Tilly decided to combine the studio with their efforts at Brown University and hold all the events at Brown U.

Rather than teach you a pattern of steps, we offer programing that trains your BODY, MIND + SOUL. Argentine Tango is a social dance as well powerful form of art. Our curriculum reflects a commitment to teach tango in all of its many facets- from beginner social dancers to professional artists. We treat anyone who walks through our doors like a dancer. This means providing multiple ways to train your body and your mind to reach your own personal goals in dance.\r\n\r\n​Our classes range from specific topics in tango, to more general movement classes for stretching or facilitating body awareness. We are proud to offer body work to our students to help them maintain their physical health and agility.\r\n\r\n<strong>TANGO AS A SOCIAL DANCE</strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">We provide instruction for absolute beginners to advanced dancers interested in tango as a social dance. Our teaching is focused on continuity and quality. This means from your very first tango lesson, you will be taught from a consistent and carefully planned curriculum. Our technique builds strong, versatile and musical social dancers who understand the culture of tango.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>TANGO AS AN ART FORM</strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">We approach Argentine Tango as one would any other classical dance. To be a tango artist / performer requires a serious commitment to training and technique. FGDA provides training for professional tango dancers, and professional dancers from other backgrounds that are looking to expand their movement and partnering skills.</span>",
