Testing Strategy Readme for TangoTiempo Application

Goals

	1.	Automated Testing: Ensure robust testing coverage for both backend (API) and frontend (UI) components of the TangoTiempo application.
	2.	Environment Separation: Maintain separate environments for production and testing to prevent interference and ensure accurate test results.
	3.	End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Validate the complete user journey from frontend interactions to backend data processing.
	4.	CI/CD Integration: Automate testing and deployment processes, running tests on every push or pull request and reverting deployments if any tests fail.

Stack and Tools

	1.	Backend & API Testing
	•	Test Framework: Jest
	•	Usage: Jest will be used for unit testing, API testing, and mocking external services.
	•	Pros: Integrated mocking capabilities, parallel test execution, built-in code coverage reporting.
	•	Mocking: Jest’s built-in mocking capabilities will be utilized to simulate external API calls and services.
	2.	Frontend Testing
	•	Component Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
	•	Usage: For testing React components to ensure they render and behave as expected.
	•	Pros: Promotes testing best practices by focusing on how components are used, not how they are implemented.
	3.	End-to-End Testing
	•	E2E Framework: Cypress
	•	Usage: Cypress will be used for testing the complete user flows, from interacting with the UI to verifying data persistence.
	•	Pros: Easy setup, powerful debugging tools, and great community support. Limited cross-browser testing, but sufficient for current needs.
	4.	CI/CD Pipeline
	•	GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
	•	Testing: Integration of Jest and Cypress tests into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that tests run on every push or pull request.
	•	Environment Configuration:
	•	NODE_ENV: Set to TEST for testing, switching the database connection to TangoTempoTest.
	•	Secrets & Environment Variables: Managed through GitHub Secrets and Azure environment variables. Azure environment variables will override GitHub Secrets if both are present.
	•	Integration Tests: Set up integration tests that run on the test environment, with options to preserve failed test logs for debugging.
	•	Deployment Logic: If tests pass, deploy the new version. Revert changes if any test fails during the deployment process to ensure production stability.

Steps for Implementation

	1.	Setup Test Databases:
	•	Ensure TangoTiempoTest database is ready and seeded with snapshot data from production.
	2.	Jest for API and Component Testing:
	•	Write unit tests for individual functions and components.
	•	Write API tests for each endpoint in the backend.
	•	Utilize Jest’s mocking capabilities to simulate external API responses.
	3.	Cypress for E2E Testing:
	•	Create E2E tests that cover major user flows, such as logging in, event creation, and navigation.
	•	Ensure that Cypress is configured to run in the CI/CD pipeline.
	4.	CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
	•	Integrate Jest and Cypress tests into GitHub Actions workflow.
	•	Manage environment variables via GitHub Secrets and Azure for consistent testing environments.
	•	Set up integration testing in the pipeline, with a mechanism to rollback changes if tests fail.

Known Issues and Considerations

	•	Mocking Challenges: While Jest’s mocking capabilities are strong, complex integrations may require additional configuration or libraries.
	•	Cross-Browser Testing: Cypress’s limited cross-browser testing might be a constraint if the application needs to support a wide range of browsers in the future.
	•	CI/CD Integration: Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in both GitHub and Azure to prevent issues during testing and deployment.

This readme should guide the team in setting up and maintaining an effective testing strategy for the TangoTiempo application, ensuring quality and stability across deployments.
