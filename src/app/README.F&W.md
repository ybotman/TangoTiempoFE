red & Wilma (F&W) Process - README

Fred:

    •	When the user submits a .js file, the process called “Fred” is triggered.
    •	The file’s lines of code are counted, and the response includes:
    1.	File name.
    2.	Number of lines of code.
    •	The line count from “Fred” will be used to track consistency and changes over time.

Wilma:

    •	When the AI generates a full .js file, the process called “Wilma” is triggered.
    •	The AI will count the lines of the generated code and respond with:
    1.	File name.
    2.	Number of lines of code.

    •	“Wilma” only applies to complete code generated by the AI (not snippets).

Consistency Check:

    •	If invoked by the user with the term F&W, the AI must review both “Fred” and “Wilma” line counts.
    •	The line count from Fred (submitted code) should typically be smaller or similar to Wilma (generated code) after optimizations or enhancements.  If Wilma is signifilaty smaller (>15%) then a new Event has been named called "Barney"

Important :

    If WILMA is greater then FRED, a 'Pebbles' occured.  This is good.
    IF THE WILMA IS SMALLER THEN FRED, then a 'Barney' occurs. then you must attempt to acqnknowlege the Barney to the user.
    Every 'Barney' will cuase a recheck against THE submitted CODE with ALL of the origial code
    Rebuild the code and F&W again. If Barney ask for the code again.
    Asking for the code again is a Dino.  I can ask you do want a Dino, and you can say this as well.
    If you cannot review with the original code as for the Code again (with a Dino).

     All full code presentation,  should invoke the F&W process to get a P or B.

Therefore:
Every use .js Submit makes Fred by counting the rows submitted
Evey full code (.js) count the rows generated, and is a wilma
Every Wilma makes (Wilma - Fred) and a Barney or a Pebbles is mande. We want a pebbles. WE WANT PEBBLES!
